## Scene 1, The Veteran

Ten years in the void. The same asteroid field, the same golden light, but the ship is different — bigger, scarred, upgraded. A veteran's vessel. Inside the cockpit, the space has become a home. Scratched tallies, photos pinned to panels, tools clipped to the dash. And in the centre: an empty bracket. The crude mount where the Scottium shard used to sit. He gave it away.

A shuttle crosses the background. New miners heading to The Howling Mine. He watches it pass the way you watch a memory fly by.

> "Ten years out here. You'd think the void gets smaller. It doesn't. Just gets... familiar."
>
> "Still see the shuttles come in. Full of kids with nothing but a ticket and a dream. Gave one of 'em something before he left Setesh. A little piece of what's out here. Wrapped it in welding wire myself. Told him what the old man told me."

## Scene 2, Blue Light in the Dark

A distress call. Shuttle down. By the time he arrives there's nothing but wreckage — twisted hull, sparking electronics, a red beacon pulsing like a dying heartbeat. No survivors. He scans the debris. Professional. Steady. He's seen this before.

Then, among the drifting metal and broken glass, a faint electric blue glow. Small, tumbling. His miner's brain registers Scottium before conscious thought. But the shape is wrong. It's not a fragment. It's wrapped. Twisted welding wire catches starlight around a tiny blue crystal, spinning slowly on a severed cord.

He made that.

His hand moves to the empty bracket on his dash. Touches it. His jaw sets. Something behind his eyes stops being grief and starts being something with edges.

> "Got the distress call mid-shift. Shuttle down. Transit corridor seven."
>
> "By the time I got there... no survivors. Never are, when they hit a shuttle."
>
> (Silence. Then barely above a whisper:) "...I made that."

## Scene 3, Getting the Band Together

It takes weeks. The comms network out here is held together with old relays and stubbornness. Half the channels are dark. He works from a makeshift war room in The Howling Mine station — star maps on the walls, too few people in too many chairs. He cycles through frequencies. Static. Dead channels. Then a voice. Then another.

One by one, they answer. Old friends. Strangers. People who'd been hit themselves and never forgot. Ships arrive from different vectors — mining ships with bolted-on weapons, old combat vessels repurposed and repurposed again. Nothing matches. Everything works. They dock, they orbit, they gather. When he looks out his cockpit at the fleet, the view is full of lights.

> "Took weeks just to get the word out. Comms out here are held together with spit and old relays."
>
> "But one by one... they answered. Old friends. Strangers. People who'd been hit themselves and never forgot."
>
> "Wasn't pretty. Wasn't military. But when I looked out that window... I saw something worth fighting for."

## Scene 4, Hidden in Plain Sight

The fleet enters deep asteroid territory. Dense, dark, claustrophobic. Running lights dimmed. Weapons cold. They navigate in silence between rocks the size of mountains.

Then the scanner resolves something wrong. An asteroid that's too regular, too geometric. Heat signatures where there should be cold rock. The display peels the asteroid back to reveal structure — docking bays in crevasses, weapons disguised as rock, a reactor core buried deep. It's not behind the asteroids. It IS the asteroids. A parasite grown into the rock. They've been flying past it for years.

> "Intel said the base was buried deep. Hidden in the rocks where scanners bounce and signals die."
>
> "And then we saw it. It was right there. It was always right there."
>
> "They'd built it into the rock. Into the field we'd been mining for years. We'd been flying past these bastards every day and never knew it."

---

## Scene 5, Burn It Down

They hit before dawn. Not that there's dawn out here. The fleet lights up — weapons hot, engines full burn, formation spreading into attack wings. The base fights back. Concealed turrets erupt from rock surfaces, pirate ships scramble from hidden hangars. The asteroid field becomes a kill box.

But miners fight different from soldiers. Soldiers fight to win. Miners fight because they've got nowhere else to go. An improvised mining ship scores a kill. Then another. The fleet pushes through. Heavy ships focus fire on the main structure and the asteroid itself cracks open — reactor detonating, corridors burning, the whole rock splitting apart with fire.

He watches the base burn through his windscreen. Orange light fills the cockpit. It doesn't feel like he thought it would.

> "We hit 'em before dawn. Not that there's dawn out here. But you know what I mean."
>
> "Miners fight different from soldiers. Soldiers fight to win. Miners fight 'cause they've got nowhere else to go."
>
> "When the main reactor went... felt it through the hull. The whole rock split open."
>
> "We burned it to the foundations. Every last corridor. Every last dock." (beat) "Didn't feel like I thought it would."

## Scene 6, The Truth Lights Up

Three hours of celebration. Drinks, laughter, the bond of shared battle. Then the relay network comes online. The last node connects. The system boots, the star map populates with real-time data from every connected system.

And the screen fills.

Red markers. Pirate activity. Distress signals. Active raids. Destroyed shuttles. Not one or two — hundreds. Every system, every transit corridor, every planet's orbit. The map drowns in red. The celebration noise dies as people drift in from the next room, drawn by silence. Nobody speaks. They watch the red spread.

> "For about three hours... we were kings."
>
> "Then the relay network lit up. Last node came online that same night."
>
> "We thought we'd cut the head off the snake. There was no head. There was no snake. Just... teeth. Everywhere."
>
> "The shuttle that kid was on. That wasn't a one-off. That was a Tuesday."

## Scene 7, The Acceptance

He sits alone with the map until the station lights come up. Three hundred red dots and counting. Then he leaves. Undocks. Heads back to the asteroid field. Not running — returning. To the work, the rocks, the life. Except now his dash runs two displays: mining data in amber, relay network in red. Both are the job now.

His gaze drifts to the empty bracket. He opens a compartment and takes out a spool of welding wire and a raw Scottium shard. Uncut. Fresh from the rocks. His hands twist the wire around the crystal. Pliers, cockpit light, the hum of the ship. He holds it up. Blue glow through twisted wire. Identical to the one he lost. A new promise for a kid he hasn't met yet.

He clips it to the dash beside the empty bracket. Two mounts. One full, one empty. Hope and loss, side by side.

Through the asteroid field, a small ship appears. New. Entry-level. Finding its way for the first time. He was them once.

> "Can't kill 'em all. Can't even find 'em all."
>
> "So you do what miners do. You go back to work."

---

## Scene 8, Fade to Black

His ship heads out. Mining beam active. Business as usual, except for the red glow sharing the dash with the amber. The new pendant catches cockpit light beside the empty bracket. Through the field, the new ship picks its way through the rocks.

> "Void's bigger than I thought. Darker, too. But I've been dark before."
>
> "And there are kids out there... flying shuttles full of dreams. Someone's gotta make sure they land."

Fade to black. Silence. Then three lines in the dark.

> "Still got wire. Still got shards. Still got fight."

## The Arc

**Competence → Loss → Grief Becoming War → The Rally → The Hunt → The Assault → Hollow Victory → The Truth → Acceptance → The Pendant Remade → The Cycle Continues**

## The Pendant Thread

The welding-wire pendant is Ch2's throughline, evolved from Ch1's raw shard: **given** to a new miner on Setesh → **found** floating in shuttle wreckage, the recognition → **mourned** through the empty bracket on the dash → **remade** with new wire and a new shard → **mounted** beside the empty bracket, hope and loss sharing the same space. The original shard was about personal fortune. The pendant is about legacy — what you hand to someone else and what survives when they don't.

## Thematic Progression

**Ch1 (Blue on Black):** Can I survive out here? → Yes. And I belong.  
**Ch2 (Dogs of War):** Can I fight back? → Yes. But the fight never ends. So you keep fighting anyway.
