# THE HOWLING MINE: DOGS OF WAR — Plot Points

**Quick reference for the team. Spoilers for everything.**

---

### THE SETUP

1. **Ten years have passed.** He's a veteran. Better ship, battle scars, reputation. The Scottium shard from Ch1 is gone — he gave it away. Empty bracket on the dash.

2. **He paid it forward.** Went back to Setesh. Found a kid in a bar. Wrapped his shard in welding wire, made it into a pendant, gave it away with the same words the old man told him: *"That's what's out there, kid."*

### THE INCITING INCIDENT

3. **A shuttle is destroyed.** New miners, killed by pirates in a transit corridor. He arrives at the wreckage. No survivors.

4. **He finds the pendant.** Floating in the debris — a Scottium shard wrapped in welding wire. His wire. His hands. His gift. The kid he gave it to was on that shuttle. He knows before the manifest confirms it.

5. **Grief becomes war.** Hand on the empty bracket. Jaw sets. This is where the Dogs of War are born.

### THE RALLY

6. **He calls in every favour.** Weeks of broken comms, dead relays, difficult channels. The community is scattered across systems now. Hard to get them in one room.

7. **They answer.** One by one. Old friends while strangers. Ships arrive at The Howling Mine — mismatched, patched-up, armed. Not an army. A community with teeth.

### THE HUNT

8. **The fleet goes dark.** Dense asteroid territory. Running lights off. Weapons cold. Submarine tension.

9. **The base is found.** Hidden in plain sight — built INTO the asteroid field they've been mining for years. The shock isn't the base. It's the location.

### THE ASSAULT

10. **They attack.** Full fleet engagement. The base fights back — concealed turrets, scrambled fighters. Chaos.

11. **Miners fight different.** Not clean, not military. Desperate, furious, personal. They break through.

12. **The base is destroyed.** The main asteroid cracks open. Reactor detonates. Everything burns.

13. **Hollow victory.** He watches it burn. It doesn't feel like he thought it would. The kid is still dead.

### THE TRUTH

14. **Three hours of celebration.** Then the relay network comes online for the first time.

15. **The map fills with red.** Hundreds of pirate attacks. Every system. Every planet. Live, happening right now. The shuttle attack that started this wasn't a one-off — it was a Tuesday.

16. **The celebration dies.** Miners crowd into the relay room. Silence. The tool they built to protect themselves just showed them how big the problem really is.

### THE ACCEPTANCE

17. **He sits with the map all night.** Alone. Processing. Three hundred red dots.

18. **He goes back to work.** Not defeated — matured. His dash now runs two displays: mining data and the relay network. Both are the job.

19. **He makes a new pendant.** Welding wire. Raw Scottium shard. Same hands, same craft. Clips it to the dash beside the empty bracket. Two mounts: one for hope, one for memory.

20. **A new miner appears in the field.** Small ship, finding its way. The cycle continues. He was them once. Soon he'll be the old miner in a bar again.

### THE CLOSE

21. **"Still got wire. Still got shards. Still got fight."**

### ONE-LINE SUMMARY

A veteran miner loses someone he tried to inspire, rallies a community to destroy the pirates responsible, wins — then discovers the enemy is everywhere, endless, and eternal. He goes back to work anyway, and makes another pendant for the next kid.
