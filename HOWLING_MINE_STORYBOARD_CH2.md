---

## SCENE 1: THE VETERAN, "Ten Years in the Void"

**Setting:** The Howling Mine asteroid field. The same territory from Chapter 1, but the ship is different — bigger, battle-scarred, upgraded. The miner is established. This is his domain now.

**Film Theory:** In medias res. No preamble. Campbell's "Master of Two Worlds" — except we're about to prove he isn't. The opening mirrors Ch1's Scene 8 (Back to Business) deliberately: same visual language, same warmth, same peace. The audience should feel safe. That safety is a lie.

**Tonal Shift from Ch1:** Ch1 opened with yearning and confinement. Ch2 opens with competence and routine. The danger is that competence breeds complacency — and the audience should feel that comfort before it's shattered.

### CUT 1A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide beauty shot, the asteroid field, a veteran at work
- **Movement:** Slow tracking shot. A heavy, upgraded mining vessel navigates the asteroid field with practiced confidence. This isn't the scrappy starter ship from Chapter 1 — this is a machine that's been through wars and come out the other side. Scars and upgrades in equal measure.
- **Voiceover:** _"Ten years out here. You'd think the void gets smaller."_
- **Mood:** Earned peace. Mastery. The audience recognises the asteroid field, the warm gold lighting, the mining beams in the distance. Home.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic shot of a large, battle-scarred mining vessel navigating confidently through an asteroid field. The ship is heavily upgraded — visible weapon mounts alongside mining equipment, welded armour plates, mismatched hull panels from years of repairs. It moves with deliberate, practiced ease between tumbling asteroids. Golden starlight illuminates the scene. Other mining ships are visible in the far background. The asteroid field feels familiar, warm, lived-in. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition. Warm gold palette. The ship is the visual centre — it tells a story through its scars.

### CUT 1B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, the veteran's world
- **Movement:** Slow pan across the cockpit. This space has become a home. Personal touches everywhere — scratched tallies, a photo or hologram pinned to a panel, tools clipped to the dash. Mining data scrolls on well-worn displays. And there, in the centre of the dash — an empty bracket. The crude mount where the Scottium shard used to sit. It's gone. He gave it away. The bracket remains like an empty picture frame.
- **Voiceover:** _"It doesn't. Just gets... familiar."_
- **Mood:** Intimacy. The cockpit is a biography. But the empty bracket is the emotional seed — the audience who saw Ch1 will notice. Where's the shard? That question hangs.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit of a veteran's mining spacecraft. The space is personalised and lived-in — scratched tally marks on the console edge, a small photo or holographic image pinned to a side panel, tools and equipment clipped neatly within reach. Well-worn instrument displays glow warm amber with mining data. The pilot's hands rest comfortably on the controls, relaxed. On the centre of the dashboard: a small crude metal bracket — empty. It once held something precious but now there's nothing in it. The bracket catches light, conspicuous in its emptiness. Through the windscreen: the familiar golden glow of the asteroid field. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Slow interior pan. Warm amber tones. The empty bracket should draw the eye — a void in a space full of objects.

### CUT 1C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Medium exterior, then interior — a shuttle passes in the background
- **Movement:** The mining ship works a claim. In the background, a passenger shuttle crosses the frame — the same kind of shuttle from Ch1, carrying new miners from Setesh to The Howling Mine. The pilot notices it through his viewport. Pauses. Watches it cross. A flicker of something on his face — memory, protectiveness, something he can't name.
- **Voiceover:** _"Still see the shuttles come in. Full of kids with nothing but a ticket and a dream."_ (beat) _"Gave one of 'em something before he left Setesh. A little piece of what's out here. Wrapped it in welding wire myself. Told him what the old man told me."_
- **Mood:** The pay-it-forward moment, told in retrospect. The audience now knows: the shard is gone because he gave it away. The empty bracket is explained. The VO is warm, fond — he's proud of this. He doesn't know what's coming.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A mining spacecraft in the foreground working an asteroid claim, mining beam active. In the background, a small passenger shuttle crosses the frame, heading deeper into the asteroid field — the same utilitarian design as the shuttle from the first chapter. Through the mining ship's cockpit viewport, the pilot is visible turning to watch the shuttle pass. The shuttle's engine trail is a thin line of light. The asteroid field stretches in every direction. Golden mining light in the foreground, the shuttle small and distant. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium-wide composition. The shuttle is small but the eye is drawn to it. Warm tones throughout but the shuttle carries a subtle vulnerability — it's small against the void.

---

## SCENE 2: THE WRECKAGE, "Blue Light in the Dark"

**Setting:** Open space near a transit corridor. Shuttle debris field. Cold, dark, wrong.

**Film Theory:** Hitchcock's bomb — the audience already suspects something the character doesn't. The VO just told us about the kid and the shard. Now we see shuttle wreckage. The audience connects the dots before he does. That gap is agony. Eisenstein's intellectual montage: juxtaposing the warm memory (1C) against cold wreckage creates meaning in the collision.

**Tonal Shift:** Warm gold drops to cold blue-grey. Music thins to almost nothing. This is the rupture.

### CUT 2A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide shot, the debris field
- **Movement:** Static wide. The miner's ship arrives at the scene. Shuttle wreckage drifts in the void — twisted hull panels, sparking electronics, venting gas. Emergency beacon pulses red. No intact structure remains. This shuttle was torn apart.
- **Voiceover:** _"Got the distress call mid-shift. Shuttle down. Transit corridor seven."_ (beat) _"By the time I got there..."_
- **Mood:** Dread. The audience already fears what this is. The debris field is cold and silent against the void. Red emergency beacon pulses like a dying heartbeat.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic shot of a spacecraft arriving at a shuttle debris field in open space. Twisted wreckage drifts in every direction — torn hull panels, shattered viewport glass, sparking electrical systems, venting gas clouds. A red emergency beacon pulses among the wreckage, casting rhythmic red light across nearby debris. The arriving ship is silhouetted against the destruction. No intact shuttle structure remains — this was total destruction. The scene is cold, dark, lit only by the beacon and distant starlight. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition. Cold blue-grey palette with pulsing red beacon. The wreckage field should feel vast and final.

### CUT 2B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, scanning the wreckage
- **Movement:** Inside the cockpit. The pilot is professional, steady — he's seen wreckage before. Scanner runs over the debris field. Readouts showing hull composition, trajectory analysis. No life signs. He expected that. His face is grim but controlled. A veteran processing a loss. This is not the first time.
- **Voiceover:** _"No survivors. Never are, when they hit a shuttle. Those things are tin cans with engines."_
- **Mood:** Controlled grief. He's not broken — not yet. This is routine tragedy. The audience is ahead of him, already looking for the shard.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit, the veteran pilot scanning shuttle wreckage through his windscreen. Holographic scanner data overlays the debris field — trajectory lines, hull composition markers, a large "NO LIFE SIGNS" readout in red. The pilot's face is lit by the cold data, expression grim but professional. Through the glass: twisted metal and debris drift past slowly. The cockpit's warm amber instruments feel muted against the cold scene outside. The pilot is steady. This is work he's done before. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium interior shot. Split lighting — cold from outside, residual warm from instruments. Professional grief.

### CUT 2C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Close exterior / cockpit POV — the shard appears
- **Movement:** Debris drifts past the viewport. Metal. Insulation. Personal items tumbling in zero-G. Then — a faint electric blue glow, rotating slowly through the field. Small. Almost lost among the wreckage. The pilot's eyes track it automatically — Scottium registers in a miner's brain before conscious thought. But something is wrong. The glow is the right colour but the shape is wrong for raw ore. It's not a fragment. It's... wrapped. Twisted welding wire catches starlight around a tiny blue crystal, spinning slowly on a severed cord.
- **Voiceover:** _(Silence. The VO cuts out. Just the sound of the cockpit — the hum of systems, the slow ping of the scanner, and the pilot's breathing, which stops.)_
- **Mood:** The gut punch. No words. The audience sees the welding wire and understands before the camera even focuses. The silence where the narration should be tells everything — this is a moment he still can't speak over, even looking back. The blue glow that meant fortune in Ch1 now means loss.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Close shot of debris drifting past a spacecraft cockpit viewport. Among twisted metal and floating wreckage fragments, a small object tumbles slowly — a Scottium crystal shard wrapped in rough welding wire, hanging from a severed cord. The shard emits that unmistakable electric blue glow, but the welding wire around it catches starlight — clearly handmade, clearly deliberate, clearly not a natural fragment. The wire is twisted with visible tool marks, a miner's craft. The shard rotates slowly against the cold debris field. Through the viewport reflection: the pilot's face, frozen, breath stopped. The blue light from the shard illuminates the glass and the ghost of his expression. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Close focus on the pendant — shallow depth of field. The welding wire is the detail that destroys. Electric blue against cold grey wreckage. The reflection of recognition in the glass.

### CUT 2D

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Interior cockpit, the reaction
- **Movement:** The pilot's hand moves to the empty bracket on his dash. Touches it. His fingers rest where the shard used to sit. He stares out at the pendant drifting away. His jaw sets. Something changes behind his eyes — not grief collapsing, but grief hardening into something else. Something with edges.
- **Voiceover:** _(Still silence. Then, barely above a whisper:)_ _"...I made that."_
- **Mood:** Three words that carry the weight of the entire scene. He made the pendant. He gave it away with hope. Now it's floating in a graveyard. The hand on the empty bracket is the visual — he's touching the absence. The hardening is the turn: this is where grief becomes purpose. This is where the Dogs of War are born.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit, tight on the pilot. His hand reaches to the dashboard and touches an empty metal bracket — the mount where his Scottium shard once sat, now vacant. His fingers rest on the bare bracket. His face is partially lit by the faint blue glow from outside — the pendant still visible through the viewport, drifting. His expression shifts from shock to something harder, colder, more resolved. The warm cockpit amber is almost gone — overwhelmed by cold blue from the wreckage scene outside. The empty bracket under his fingers is the emotional centre. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Tight interior shot. The hand on the empty bracket. Cold blue light replacing warm amber. The moment where grief becomes war.

---

## SCENE 3: THE RALLY, "Getting the Band Together"

**Setting:** Multiple locations — The Howling Mine station, deep space comm relays, scattered outposts. The community isn't in one place anymore. It's spread across systems. Getting them together is the first battle.

**Film Theory:** The "assembling the team" sequence but played against friction. Not a montage of people saying yes — a montage of _difficulty_. Comms that don't connect. Relays that are down. Distances measured in days. This community was always held together by proximity and now it's scattered. The Seven Samurai structure — each ally has to be sought.

**Tonal Shift:** Cold from Scene 2 thaws into something more determined. Not warm yet — warm comes when the fleet gathers. This is the hard, unglamorous work of making war happen.

### CUT 3A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Interior, The Howling Mine station — war room energy
- **Movement:** A makeshift operations space inside the mining station. Star maps projected on walls. The miner stands with a small group — not many, not enough. He's pointing at the map, talking with intensity. Others listen, some skeptical, some resolved. This isn't a rousing speech — it's a man calling in every favour he has.
- **Voiceover:** _"Took weeks just to get the word out. Comms out here are held together with spit and old relays. Half the network's been dark for years."_
- **Mood:** Determination against friction. The community from Ch1 has grown and scattered. Pulling it back together is hard, thankless work. But he's doing it.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior of a makeshift operations room inside a mining station. Star maps and system charts are projected on the metal walls — holographic displays showing transit routes, relay positions, and mining outpost locations. A veteran miner stands at the centre, gesturing at the map with intensity, addressing a small group of 4-5 other miners and pilots. The room is utilitarian — cargo crates as seats, exposed conduit, borrowed equipment. Some faces show conviction, others doubt. The lighting is harsh overhead fluorescent mixed with the blue glow of holographic displays. Not enough people in the room. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium-wide interior. The small number of people against the vast map emphasises how much bigger this is than them.

### CUT 3B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Montage beat — comms relay, reaching out
- **Movement:** Quick cuts. The miner at a communications console, cycling through frequencies. Static. Dead channels. Then a voice breaks through — garbled, distant, but real. A relay miles away crackles to life. Another outpost responds. Then another. The network is patchy, broken, unreliable — but alive.
- **Voiceover:** _"But one by one... they answered. Old friends. Strangers. People who'd been hit themselves and never forgot."_
- **Mood:** Slow-building hope. Each voice on the comm is a small victory against distance and entropy.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A veteran miner hunched over a deep-space communications console in a dimly lit station room. Multiple frequency displays show static and dead channels — flat lines, error messages, "NO SIGNAL" readouts. But one channel is active, waveform pulsing with a distant voice. The pilot's hand adjusts a dial. Multiple small screens surround him showing different relay statuses — most red, a few flickering to green. The room is dark except for the console glow. The scene speaks to the difficulty of connection across vast space. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Close-medium on the pilot and console. Cool blue-green console light in darkness. The few green signals among the red are the hope.

### CUT 3C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide exterior — ships arriving at The Howling Mine
- **Movement:** The Howling Mine station. Ships arriving from different vectors — some through warp, some drifting in on conventional drives. Different sizes, different conditions. Mining ships with bolted-on weapons. Old combat vessels repurposed for mining, now repurposed back for war. Nothing matches. Everything works. They dock, they orbit, they gather.
- **Voiceover:** _"Wasn't pretty. Wasn't military. But when I looked out that window..."_
- **Mood:** The fleet is ugly and beautiful. It's a community made physical. Imperfect, cobbled together, held by something stronger than hardware.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic shot of The Howling Mine space station in an asteroid field, with multiple spacecraft arriving from different directions. Ships drop out of warp with light trails, others drift in on conventional engines. The gathered fleet is diverse — heavy mining vessels with welded weapon mounts, small fighters, repurposed cargo ships, old combat vessels with mining equipment strapped on. Nothing matches. Colours, sizes, designs all different. They orbit the station, dock at scaffolding gantries, hold formation nearby. The station itself is industrial, functional, lit warmly. 15-20 ships gathered. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition centred on the station. The diversity of the fleet tells the story — this is a community, not an army.

### CUT 3D

- **Duration:** 6–8 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, looking out at the fleet
- **Movement:** The miner in his cockpit, looking out at the gathered ships. Lights everywhere. Engine glows, running lights, cockpit windows. A constellation of people who showed up.
- **Voiceover:** _"...I saw something worth fighting for."_
- **Mood:** The emotional peak of the rally. Quiet awe layered with grief — these people came because of what happened to a kid on a shuttle. The community thesis from Ch1 made manifest, but this time it's proactive, not reactive.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit shot, the veteran pilot gazing out through the windscreen at a gathered fleet of allied ships. Through the glass: dozens of engine glows, running lights, and illuminated cockpit windows create a constellation of warm light in the dark void. The pilot's face is lit by the reflected glow of the fleet. His expression is moved, resolved. The warm light from outside fills the cockpit for the first time since the wreckage scene. The empty bracket on the dash is visible in the foreground. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Intimate interior with epic exterior. The fleet reflected in the glass and in his expression. Warm gold returning.

## SCENE 4: THE HUNT, "Hidden in Plain Sight"

**Setting:** Deep asteroid field. Dense, uncharted territory. The pirate base is concealed among massive asteroid formations — hiding in the gravitational shadow of rocks the size of cities.

**Film Theory:** Submarine warfare tension. Das Boot, not Star Wars. The fleet navigates in near-silence, systems dimmed, running dark. The visual language shifts from open space to claustrophobic asteroid corridors. The base reveal should be a Spielberg "Jaws moment" — you don't see it until it's enormous and right in front of you.

**Tonal Shift:** The warmth of the rally cools into tactical tension. Music drops to low drones and heartbeat rhythms. The fleet is a predator stalking prey, but the prey has teeth.

### CUT 4A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide, the fleet enters dense asteroid territory
- **Movement:** The allied fleet moves in tight formation between massive asteroids — rocks the size of buildings, some the size of mountains. The ships have dimmed their running lights. Weapons cold until needed. They're running dark.
- **Voiceover:** _"Intel said the base was buried deep. Hidden in the rocks where scanners bounce and signals die."_
- **Mood:** Tension. The asteroid field from Ch1 was a playground. This part of it is a maze. Claustrophobic, threatening. The fleet looks smaller here.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A fleet of diverse spacecraft moving in tight formation through a dense asteroid field, navigating between massive asteroids the size of mountains. The ships have dimmed their running lights — only faint outline glows visible. Weapons systems are dark. The asteroids are enormous and close, creating narrow corridors and deep shadows. The fleet threads between them carefully. The scale is intimidating — these rocks dwarf the ships. Dark, tense lighting with only faint ambient starlight and the occasional glint off asteroid surfaces. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition emphasising the claustrophobic density. The fleet is small against the rocks. Muted, desaturated palette. Submarine tension.

### CUT 4B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, scanning, the discovery
- **Movement:** Inside the cockpit. Scanner running in passive mode. The pilot watches the display, navigating by instrument. Then the scanner resolves something wrong — an asteroid ahead that's too regular. Too geometric. Heat signatures where there should be cold rock. The scanner data shifts, outlines form, and the asteroid peels back in the display to reveal— structure. A station. Built into the rock, around the rock, between the rocks. Massive.
- **Voiceover:** _"And then we saw it."_ (beat) _"It was right there. It was always right there."_
- **Mood:** The shock of recognition. Hidden in plain sight — the base isn't behind the asteroids, it IS the asteroids. Miners have been flying past it. The scanner revelation should feel like a magic eye puzzle resolving.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit view. A holographic scanner display shows a cluster of large asteroids ahead — but the scan is revealing hidden structure within them. Heat signature overlays show energy sources inside what looked like solid rock. Geometric outlines emerge in the scanner data — docking bays concealed in asteroid crevasses, weapon emplacements disguised as rock formations, a reactor core buried deep. The pilot leans forward, scanner light on his face, eyes widening. Through the windscreen: the asteroids ahead look normal to the naked eye — just rocks. But the scanner tells a different story. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Interior medium shot. The contrast between what the eyes see (rocks) and what the scanner reveals (a fortress) is the key tension. Cold scanner blue-green on the pilot's face.

### CUT 4C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide exterior reveal — the pirate base
- **Movement:** Camera drifts around a massive asteroid cluster. At first it looks natural — cratered rock, deep shadows, ordinary. Then lights appear in the shadows. Docking gantries extending from crevasses. Red running lights on concealed turrets. Ships nestled in hollowed chambers. The base reveals itself like a predator opening its eyes. It's not a building — it's a parasite on the rock itself, grown into the asteroid field like a tumour.
- **Voiceover:** _"They'd built it into the rock. Into the field we'd been mining for years. We'd been flying past these bastards every day and never knew it."_
- **Mood:** Violation. This was supposed to be home territory. The revelation that the threat was _inside_ the safe space — that's the shock. The base should feel organic and wrong, like it grew there.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic reveal of a pirate base built into and around a massive asteroid cluster. What initially appears to be natural rock formations gradually reveals hidden infrastructure — docking gantries extending from deep crevasses, red running lights on concealed weapon turrets protruding from rock faces, pirate ships nestled in hollowed-out chambers within the asteroids. The base is not a single structure but a network of installations grown into the rock like a parasite — hangars carved into asteroid interiors, armoured conduits connecting rock formations, reactor glow deep within. The aesthetic is brutal and organic — the pirates didn't build on the rocks, they infected them. Red and amber light spills from concealed openings. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide reveal composition. The base should feel like it's been here for years, growing. Dark rock with red interior light bleeding through. Menacing, violating, wrong.

---

## SCENE 5: THE ASSAULT, "Burn It Down"

**Setting:** The pirate base and surrounding asteroid field. Full-scale fleet engagement.

**Film Theory:** This is the film's action centrepiece — the set piece the audience has been waiting for since the shuttle was destroyed. Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach energy: visceral, chaotic, but with clear narrative beats within the chaos. Each cut should advance the battle's story, not just show explosions. The audience needs to feel the fleet working as one — the community thesis weaponised.

**Tonal Shift:** Controlled tension erupts into controlled fury. Music goes full orchestral assault. Warm golds of allied fire against harsh reds of pirate defence. This is the loudest the series has ever been.

### CUT 5A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide, the charge begins
- **Movement:** The allied fleet lights up — running lights blazing, weapons powering on, engines flaring to full burn. They surge forward from their hiding positions among the asteroids. The formation spreads into attack wings. First shots fire.
- **Voiceover:** _"We hit 'em before dawn. Not that there's dawn out here. But you know what I mean."_
- **Mood:** Catharsis detonating. The VO's dry humour cuts the tension — this is still a miner, not a general. But the visuals are war. The charge is glorious and terrifying.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A diverse allied fleet surging forward through an asteroid field in full attack formation. Running lights blazing, weapons charging with visible energy buildup, engines at full burn leaving brilliant golden trails. The fleet spreads into attack wings — smaller fighters leading, heavy mining vessels with bolted-on weapons following. The first golden weapon beams lance forward toward the pirate base visible ahead, built into the asteroids. The formation has the energy of a cavalry charge. Asteroids streak past as the fleet accelerates. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide dynamic composition with forward momentum. Golden weapon fire and engine trails dominate. The fleet moves as one. Epic, furious, earned.

### CUT 5B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Action, the base fights back
- **Movement:** The pirate base's concealed turrets open fire. Red weapon beams erupt from asteroid surfaces. Pirate ships launch from hidden hangars, scrambling to defend. The allied fleet takes hits — shields flare, hulls spark — but they keep coming. The asteroid field becomes a kill box of criss-crossing fire.
- **Voiceover:** _(No VO. Battle sounds. Comms chatter. The chaos speaks.)_
- **Mood:** The base has teeth. This isn't a raid on an undefended camp — it's a fortress. The pirates were ready. The allied fleet commits anyway.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Chaotic space battle erupting around a pirate base built into asteroids. Concealed turrets on the asteroid surfaces open fire with harsh red weapon beams. Pirate ships launch from hidden hangars carved into the rock — dark, angular vessels scrambling into formation. The allied fleet pushes through the fire — golden weapons blazing, some ships taking hits with shield flares and hull sparks. Criss-crossing weapon fire in red and gold fills the space between the asteroids. Explosions bloom against rock surfaces. Ships weave between asteroids and weapons fire. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Dynamic action composition. Red vs gold weapon fire. Chaos with visible structure — the allied fleet pushing in against pirate defence.

### CUT 5C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Medium/close, a pirate ship goes down
- **Movement:** An allied vessel — one of the cobbled-together mining ships with welded weapons — scores a direct hit on a pirate fighter. The pirate ship breaks apart, reactor detonating. Debris scatters. Through the explosion, more allied ships push forward. A second pirate vessel tries to flee and takes fire from multiple angles.
- **Voiceover:** _"Miners fight different from soldiers. Soldiers fight to win. Miners fight 'cause they've got nowhere else to go."_
- **Mood:** The community isn't fighting clean or pretty. But they're fighting with the fury of people defending home. The VO's distinction is the thematic heartbeat — this isn't conquest, it's protection.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A cobbled-together mining ship with welded weapon mounts scores a devastating hit on a pirate fighter. The pirate vessel's reactor detonates — a blinding explosion blooming outward, debris and fire scattering in zero gravity. Through the explosion, two more allied ships surge past, weapons firing. Another pirate ship attempts to break away but takes concentrated fire from multiple allied vessels, golden beams converging. The mining ship that scored the kill is scarred, ugly, improvised — but lethal. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium-close action. The explosion is the visual centre. The mining-ship-as-warship aesthetic is key — these aren't military craft, they're tools of industry repurposed for violence.

### CUT 5D

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide, the base is breached
- **Movement:** Allied heavy ships focus fire on the main base structure embedded in the largest asteroid. The rock itself cracks under concentrated bombardment. Internal explosions chain through the infrastructure — hangars detonating, reactor systems overloading. The asteroid splits, red fire and atmosphere venting from the wound. The base is dying.
- **Voiceover:** _"When the main reactor went... felt it through the hull. The whole rock split open."_
- **Mood:** Devastating spectacle. The asteroid — the same kind of rock they mine every day — cracking open with fire instead of ore. The inversion of the mining act: they've been cracking rocks for treasure their whole lives. Now they're cracking one to kill what's inside.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Dramatic wide shot of the pirate base being destroyed. Multiple allied ships concentrate golden weapon beams on the main asteroid structure. The massive rock is cracking open — deep fissures splitting the surface, red-orange fire and atmosphere venting from within. Internal explosions chain through the base infrastructure visible through the cracks — hangars collapsing, corridors venting, reactor systems overloading with blinding white light. The asteroid splits like an egg, the pirate base infrastructure exposed and burning inside. Allied ships pull back from the expanding debris cloud. Smaller pirate ships scatter and flee. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Ultra-wide to capture the scale of destruction. The cracking asteroid is the centrepiece — fire and structure visible through the fissures. Dominant oranges and reds from the destruction, golden weapons fire from allied ships.

### CUT 5E

- **Duration:** 6–8 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, the miner watches the base burn
- **Movement:** The pilot in his cockpit. The asteroid base is visible through the windscreen, breaking apart, burning. Orange firelight fills the cockpit. He watches it. There's satisfaction, but it's heavy — not the clean triumph the audience might expect. He's thinking about the kid on the shuttle. This doesn't bring him back.
- **Voiceover:** _"We burned it to the foundations. Every last corridor. Every last dock."_ (beat, quieter) _"Didn't feel like I thought it would."_
- **Mood:** Hollow victory seeded. The visual is spectacular but the VO undercuts it deliberately. This is the first signal that destruction alone isn't enough. The audience should feel the gap between the spectacle and the human beneath it.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit shot. The veteran pilot watches through the windscreen as the pirate base asteroid burns and breaks apart in the distance. Intense orange-red firelight from the destruction fills the cockpit, casting dramatic shadows. The pilot's face is lit by the fire — his expression is complex, not triumph but grim resolution. The warm amber of his instruments mingles with the harsh orange of the burning base. His hand rests near the empty shard bracket on the dash. Through the glass: a spectacular destruction scene, but inside the cockpit, it's quiet. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium interior. The contrast between spectacular destruction outside and quiet complexity inside is the key tension. Fire-lit cockpit. The empty bracket visible.

---

## SCENE 6: THE RELAY, "The Truth Lights Up"

**Setting:** The Howling Mine station. Post-battle. The community has returned. The last communications relay in the network comes online for the first time.

**Film Theory:** The cruelest twist is knowledge. Oedipus didn't suffer from the plague — he suffered from learning the truth. The relay network was supposed to be a tool of safety. It becomes a window into how unsafe the universe truly is. Blake Snyder's "All Is Lost" delivered not by an enemy, but by information.

**Tonal Shift:** Post-battle calm and celebration curdle into silence and scale. The relay screen should function like the monolith in 2001 — the characters gather around it and are changed by what they see.

### CUT 6A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Interior, The Howling Mine station — celebration
- **Movement:** Inside the station. Miners celebrating. Drinks, laughter, the release of tension. People who fought together feeling the bond of survival. It's raucous and warm and real. The miner is among them — not at the centre, but present. He's trying to feel it. Almost does. Someone catches his eye across the room — a face he trusts. One of the allies who answered the call in Scene 3. They share a nod, a raised glass. A real moment between two people who fought the same fight. The ally smiles. It reaches their eyes. It looks completely genuine.
- **Voiceover:** _"For about three hours... we were kings."_
- **Mood:** Earned joy with an expiration date. The VO's past tense tells the audience this won't last. But let the warmth breathe — the audience deserves it too, after the battle. **Ch3 seed:** The ally the miner shares a moment with is the Pretender. On first viewing, they're just another face in the community. On rewatch after Ch3, this frame becomes a knife.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior of The Howling Mine space station common area, packed with celebrating miners and pilots. The atmosphere is raucous — drinks raised, laughter, people clapping each other on the back. Warm amber lighting. The space is industrial but alive with energy. The veteran miner is visible in the mid-ground, drink in hand, sharing a nod and a raised glass with a specific ally across the room — a fellow fighter, someone he trusts. The connection between them is warm and real. Other faces show relief, joy, the bond of shared battle. The celebration is genuine. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium-wide interior. Warm golden tones. The crowd energy should feel real and earned. The miner and the ally's shared moment should read as the purest thing in the frame.

### CUT 6B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Interior, the relay control room — the network comes online
- **Movement:** A smaller room adjacent to the celebration. Technical equipment. A handful of people around a central display. Someone flips the last relay online — a switch, a command, a final connection. The system boots. Loading bars. Handshake protocols. Then the display populates.
- **Voiceover:** _"Then the relay network lit up. Last node came online that same night. First time the whole grid was connected."_
- **Mood:** Anticipation. The technical achievement they've been building toward. The audience doesn't know yet that this is the knife.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior of a communications relay control room in a space station. A central holographic display table dominates the room. 3-4 people gathered around it, one activating the final connection — fingers on a control panel, initiating the network. The display is booting up — loading bars, handshake protocol text scrolling, relay nodes appearing one by one on a star map. The room is dark except for the display glow — blue and green data light on focused faces. Through the doorway behind them, the celebration is visible in the next room, warm and distant. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium interior focused on the display and the faces around it. Cool technical light against warm celebration light bleeding from the doorway.

### CUT 6C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Close on the display — the truth
- **Movement:** The star map populates with real-time data from across every connected system. And the screen fills. Red markers — pirate activity. Attack reports. Distress signals. Active raids. Destroyed shuttles. Compromised shipping lanes. Not one or two — dozens. Hundreds. Every system, every transit corridor, every planet's orbit. The map drowns in red. The celebration noise from the next room fades as people drift in, drawn by the silence of the people already watching.
- **Voiceover:** _"We thought we'd cut the head off the snake."_ (beat) _"There was no head. There was no snake. Just... teeth. Everywhere."_
- **Mood:** The stomach drop. The map IS the horror. Scale rendered as data. Every red marker is another shuttle, another miner, another kid with a shard in his pocket. The celebration dies in silence. Nobody speaks. They just watch the red spread.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Close-up of a holographic star map display flooding with data. Hundreds of red markers populate across multiple star systems — each one an active pirate attack, a distress signal, a destroyed vessel, a compromised route. The map is drowning in red. Attack vectors, raid patterns, and loss reports scroll alongside the markers. The scale is overwhelming — this isn't one base, one system, one problem. It's everywhere. Reflected in the glass of the display: the faces of miners who moments ago were celebrating, now frozen, lit red by the data. The celebration has stopped. People stand in silence. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Close on the display with reflected faces. Red dominates everything. The data is the villain. The silence is louder than the battle was.

### CUT 6D

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide interior, the room fills, the celebration dies
- **Movement:** Wide shot of the relay room. More people from the celebration crowd into the doorway, drawn by the silence. The holographic map blazes red at the centre. Everyone is looking at it. No one is drinking anymore. The miner stands near the front, jaw set. He's looking at the map, but we can see — he's not surprised. Part of him always knew. He just didn't have proof until now.
- **Voiceover:** _"The shuttle that kid was on. That wasn't a one-off. That was a Tuesday."_
- **Mood:** The line "that was a Tuesday" should land like a punch to the chest. The kid's death wasn't unique — it was _routine_. It's happening right now, somewhere the map is showing them, and nobody was connected enough to see it until this moment. The community's greatest achievement — the relay network — just told them their greatest fear.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide interior shot of the relay control room, now crowded. Miners and pilots fill the room and the doorway, drinks forgotten in their hands. The central holographic display blazes red with hundreds of threat markers across the star map. Every face is turned toward it, lit in red. The celebration is dead. The veteran miner stands near the front of the crowd, jaw set, arms at his sides. The room is silent. The only light comes from the map — cold, red, relentless. The warm amber of the celebration in the background room is still faintly visible but no one is in there anymore. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide interior. The crowd facing the red display like a congregation facing a sermon they didn't want to hear. Silence as a visual concept — the stillness of every body in the room.

## SCENE 7: THE ACCEPTANCE, "The War That Doesn't End"

**Setting:** The Howling Mine station, then deep space. The aftermath of truth. The hardest lesson in the void: there is no final fight, only the next one.

**Film Theory:** The Coen Brothers' ending philosophy — resolution without resolution. Life doesn't climax and conclude; it continues. No Country for Old Men: the villain doesn't get caught, the hero doesn't win, and the world keeps turning. But unlike that nihilism, this carries Campbell's "Freedom to Live" — the hero transcends the need for a final victory and finds meaning in the _ongoing_. Sisyphus, but Camus told us to imagine him happy.

**Tonal Shift:** Red cools to deep blue, then warms — slowly, painfully — back to amber. Not the naïve gold of Ch1. A tempered warmth. Fire-tested. The music should feel like breathing after holding breath too long.

### CUT 7A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Interior station, the morning after
- **Movement:** The relay room, hours later. Most people have left. Cups and bottles on surfaces. The holographic map still glows, still red, still relentless. The miner sits alone in front of it. He's been here all night. The red light on his face. He's not despairing — he's processing. The map is his new scanner. It shows threats instead of ore, but the reading is the same: infinite, everywhere, unending.
- **Voiceover:** _"Sat with that map 'til the station lights came up. Counting red dots. Lost count around three hundred."_
- **Mood:** Solitary reckoning. The loneliest moment in the series. But not broken — _sitting with_ the truth, not running from it. He's absorbing the scale on his own terms.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior relay control room in the early hours. The room is mostly empty — abandoned cups and bottles on surfaces, chairs pushed back. The holographic star map still glows at the centre, red markers still active. The veteran miner sits alone in front of it, hunched slightly forward, face lit entirely in red. He's been here for hours. The station's ambient lights are coming up — faint warm strips along the ceiling beginning to glow. But the red map still dominates. The miner is alone with the truth. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium-wide interior. The lone figure against the glowing map. Red fading as station lights warm. Solitude as processing, not defeat.

### CUT 7B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Exterior, the miner's ship departing the station
- **Movement:** Wide. The miner's ship undocks from The Howling Mine station and heads out into the asteroid field. Behind him, the station. Ahead, the void. He's leaving, but not the way he left Setesh in Ch1. This isn't escape. This is return — to the work, to the rocks, to the life. Except now he knows what the life really costs.
- **Voiceover:** _"Can't kill 'em all. Can't even find 'em all."_
- **Mood:** Quiet departure. Not running toward or away. Just... going back. The simplest act of defiance: continuing.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic shot of a veteran mining spacecraft undocking from The Howling Mine space station and heading out into the asteroid field. The station recedes behind, still lit warmly. Ahead: the familiar asteroid field, golden starlight on tumbling rocks. The ship moves steadily, not urgently — a working pace. The void stretches as always. Other mining ships are faintly visible at their claims in the distance. The scene is quiet, wide, open. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition. The ship between the station behind and the void ahead. Warm gold returning but tempered, less innocent than before.

### CUT 7C

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior — the new routine
- **Movement:** Inside the cockpit. Everything where it should be. The scanner runs — but now he's running two displays. One shows asteroid composition, ore deposits, mining data. The other shows the relay network — a miniature version of the red map, live pirate activity, distress frequencies, fleet positions. Mining and war on the same dash. He looks between them. Both are the job now. His hand rests on the controls. And then his gaze drifts to the empty bracket on the dash. He looks at it for a long beat. Then opens a small compartment and takes something out — a spool of welding wire. And a raw Scottium shard. Uncut. Unset. Fresh from the rocks.
- **Voiceover:** _"So you do what miners do."_ (beat) _"You go back to work."_
- **Mood:** The cycle beginning again. He's going to make another pendant. Give it to another kid. Knowing full well what happened to the last one. That's not naïveté — that's defiance against the dark. The welding wire is the most meaningful object in the frame. The audience will understand before the camera even shows what he's doing.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit of the veteran miner's ship. Two displays are active side by side — one showing mining scanner data with ore deposits and asteroid readouts in warm amber, the other showing the relay network map with scattered red markers of pirate activity. Both screens glow simultaneously. The pilot sits between them — mining and war on the same dashboard. His gaze has drifted to the empty bracket on the centre dash. His hand opens a small storage compartment and retrieves a spool of rough welding wire and a raw, uncut Scottium shard — the blue crystal glowing faintly in his palm. The wire and the shard together in his hands. Through the windscreen: the asteroid field, golden, infinite, waiting. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium interior. The two screens (amber mining, red relay) frame him. The shard and welding wire in his hands are the focal point. Warm amber and faint blue. The cycle begins again.

### CUT 7D

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Close on his hands — making the pendant
- **Movement:** Tight close-up. His hands work the welding wire around the new Scottium shard. Rough, practiced. Pliers twist the wire. The shard is locked in place. He holds it up. It catches the cockpit light. Blue glow through twisted wire. The same as before. Identical. A new promise for a new kid he hasn't met yet.
- **Voiceover:** _(No VO. The sound of pliers on wire, the hum of the cockpit, and silence. The image speaks.)_
- **Mood:** The most powerful visual callback in the series. The audience watched the first pendant float dead in shuttle wreckage. Now they watch him make another one. Same hands. Same wire. Same hope, knowing the cost. This is Camus' Sisyphus choosing to push the boulder again — not because the boulder will stay, but because the pushing is the meaning.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Extreme close-up of weathered hands working welding wire around a raw Scottium crystal shard. Pliers twist the rough wire into place, securing the glowing blue crystal. The hands are scarred, experienced — a miner's hands. The shard emits a soft electric blue glow through the twisted wire cage, illuminating the fingers and the wire. The work is rough but deliberate — not jewellery, not art, just a miner wrapping treasure in the only material he has. The finished pendant is identical to the one lost in the shuttle wreckage. Warm amber cockpit light from above, blue shard glow from below. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Extreme close-up. Hands, wire, shard. The blue glow through twisted wire is the visual thesis of hope persisting through loss. This is the most intimate shot in the series.

## SCENE 8: THE CUT, "Fade to Black"

**Film Theory:** Mirror Ch1's ending structure but with evolved weight. The ship recedes, the VO closes, the darkness comes — but the final line reframes everything. The stinger isn't defiance this time. It's purpose. Then the _real_ stinger: the corridor. The question. A Marvel-style post-emotional-credits beat that seeds Ch3 without explaining anything.

### CUT 8A

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Wide, the ship heading out, relay data pulsing on the dash
- **Movement:** Wide exterior. The miner's ship heads out into the asteroid field. Mining beam activates on the nearest rock. Business as usual. Except the relay data is visible through the cockpit glass — that faint red glow alongside the warm amber of the instruments. Both realities sharing the same space. Then, through the field, another ship appears. Small. New. A starter vessel finding its way through the rocks for the first time.
- **Voiceover:** _"Void's bigger than I thought. Darker, too."_
- **Mood:** The wide shot should echo Ch1's ending — same field, same light, same beauty. But the red glow on the dash says: he knows now. And the small ship approaching says: it never stops. Life cycles. New miners arrive. The story repeats.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Wide cinematic shot of a veteran mining vessel working a claim in the asteroid field — mining beam active on an asteroid, golden light, routine competence. Through the cockpit glass, two glows are visible — warm amber instruments and a faint red from the relay display. In the mid-distance, a small, new, clearly entry-level spacecraft picks its way cautiously through the asteroids — a new miner finding their way. The veteran's ship is confident; the new ship is tentative. The asteroid field is golden and beautiful. The two ships share the frame. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Wide composition. The veteran and the newcomer. Gold dominates but red is present. The cycle visible in a single frame.

### CUT 8B

- **Duration:** 8–10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Cockpit interior, final moment
- **Movement:** The pilot watches the new ship through his viewport. He reaches for the pendant he just made — lifts it, looks at it in the cockpit light. Blue glow through welding wire. He clips it to a hook on the dash, right next to the empty bracket where his original shard sat. Two mounts. One full, one empty. One for memory, one for the next kid. He looks at it for a beat, then turns back to his mining controls.
- **Voiceover:** _"But I've been dark before."_ (beat, then with quiet weight) _"And there are kids out there... flying shuttles full of dreams. Someone's gotta make sure they land."_
- **Mood:** The emotional close. He's not a hero. He's a miner who makes pendants from welding wire and gives them to strangers. He can't save everyone. He couldn't save the last one. He's going to try anyway. The pendant on the dash next to the empty bracket is the final image — hope and loss, side by side, sharing the same space. Just like the amber instruments and the red relay data. That's the life. That's the void. That's the series.

> **AI Image Prompt:** Interior cockpit, final shot. The veteran pilot clips a newly made Scottium pendant — blue crystal wrapped in rough welding wire — to a small hook on the dashboard, right beside the empty bracket where his original shard once sat. Two mounts side by side: one holds the new pendant glowing faint electric blue, the other is empty — a memorial. The pilot looks at them both for a beat. Warm amber cockpit light and faint blue shard glow. Through the windscreen behind: the asteroid field, golden, infinite. His hand moves from the pendant back to the mining controls. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. Medium interior. The two dash mounts — full and empty — are the emotional centre. Warm amber with blue accent. Intimate, quiet, final.

### CUT 8C — THE QUESTION (Ch3 Stinger)

- **Duration:** 6–8 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Station corridor, security-camera angle — the ally leaves
- **Movement:** Hard cut from the warm cockpit to cold station footage. The Howling Mine station, late hours. A corridor near the docking bays — low light, industrial, empty. A figure walks the corridor alone, heading toward the external airlocks. It's the ally from the celebration. The same face, the same person. But something is wrong. The way they move is slightly off — too fluid, too certain in a dark corridor, like someone who doesn't need the light. They pass under a flickering overhead strip and for a single frame — just one — their silhouette doesn't quite match. A shoulder line that's too smooth. A height that shifted by an inch. Then they round a corner and they're gone. Hold on the empty corridor. A beat. Then, at the edge of frame, a doorway — and someone is standing in it. Another miner, half-hidden, watching where the ally just walked. Not following. Just... noticing. The watcher's face is partially lit. They don't look afraid. They look _confused_.
- **Voiceover:** _(No VO. Station ambient sound only — the hum of life support, a distant airlock cycling. Silence where a voice should be.)_
- **Mood:** The question mark. On first viewing of Ch2, this reads as an odd postscript — who left? Why? After Ch3, this becomes the most important shot in the entire chapter. The audience will remember the celebration nod, the raised glass, the warmth — and realise the Pretender was already leaving. Already done. The confused watcher in the doorway is the thread that unravels everything in Ch3: _somebody saw_.

> **AI Image Prompt:** A dimly lit corridor inside a space station, shot from a high angle like a security camera. The corridor is industrial — exposed conduit, metal grating floor, low emergency lighting strips along the walls. A single figure walks away from camera toward the far end, heading toward docking bay airlocks. The figure moves with unsettling fluidity — too smooth, too confident for the low light. Under a flickering overhead light, the figure's silhouette seems subtly wrong for a fraction of a second — proportions that don't quite hold. At the edge of frame: a doorway, and half-hidden in it, another person watching the figure walk away. The watcher's face is partially lit — confused, not frightened. Not following. Just seeing something that doesn't make sense. The corridor is cold blue-grey. 16:9, photorealistic, cinematic. High-angle surveillance composition. Cold, institutional lighting. The wrongness should be subtle — a feeling more than a fact. The watcher in the doorway is the human anchor.

**Film Theory Note:** Hitchcock's staircase — the information is given to the audience but not to the protagonist. The miner in his cockpit doesn't see this. Someone else does. That gap between who knows what is the engine of Ch3.

### CUT 8D, END CARD

- **Duration:** 10 seconds
- **Shot Type:** Fade to black, then logo and CTA
- **Movement:** Static title card
- **Voiceover:** _(Over black, before the logo:)_ _"Still got wire. Still got shards."_ (beat) _"Still got fight."_
- **Mood:** Three punches in the dark. Wire (the craft). Shards (the hope). Fight (the will). Then the brand answers. But after that corridor — the words carry a new edge. _Fight_ is no longer just about pirates. Something else is out there. The audience doesn't know what yet. They just know the void got stranger.

**Production Notes (Motion Graphics, not AI-generated):**

1. Fade from cockpit shot to solid black (1 second)
2. Hold on black (2 seconds, VO lands here)
3. The Howling Mine logo fades in with golden neon glow effect (2 seconds)
4. HowlingMine.com appears below the logo (1 second after logo)
5. Tagline: _"The Void Awaits."_ fades in below URL (1 second after URL)
6. Hold full end card for 3 seconds, then fade to black

**Estimated Runtime:** 4:30 – 5:30

### Colour Arc

Warm gold (veteran at peace) → Cold grey-blue (wreckage) → **Electric blue through welding wire** (the pendant found — the gut punch) → Grey hardening to steel (the rally) → Dark tension, muted palette (the hunt) → Explosive gold and red (the assault) → Hollow orange (the base burns) → **Drowning red** (the relay truth — the most visually aggressive moment) → Red cooling to deep blue (the morning after) → Warm amber returning, tempered, with **red always present on the dash** (the new normal) → Gold and blue together (the new pendant made) → Fade to black

### The Pendant Thread (Narrative Motif)

The welding-wire pendant is Ch2's throughline, evolved from Ch1's raw shard: **given** (1C — paid forward to the new miner on Setesh) → **lost** (2C — found floating in shuttle wreckage, the recognition) → **mourned** (2D — the empty bracket touched) → **remade** (7C/7D — new shard, same wire, same hands) → **mounted** (8B — new pendant beside the empty bracket, hope and loss sharing the dash). The original shard was about personal fortune. The pendant is about _legacy_ — what you hand to someone else and what survives when they don't.

### Narrative Arc

Master of Two Worlds (false) → Inciting Tragedy → The Gathering → The Hunt → The Assault (Ordeal) → The Truth (All Is Lost) → Acceptance → Return to Work → The Cycle Continues → Stinger → **The Question** (Ch3 seed — the ally departs, someone notices)

### Thematic Progression Across Chapters

**Ch1 (Blue on Black):** Can I survive out here? → Yes. And I belong.  
**Ch2 (Dogs of War):** Can I fight back? → Yes. But the fight never ends. So you keep fighting anyway.  
**Ch3 (The Pretender):** Can I win? → Yes. But victory costs you the world you thought you knew.
