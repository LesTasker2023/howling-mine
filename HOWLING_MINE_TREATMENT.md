## Scene 1, The Yearning

A gritty cyberpunk moon colony. Neon signs, industrial towers, metal plating slick with rain. A nobody in worn space gear walks through the motions, browsing market stalls, passing through crowds. The camera stays low, trapped at ground level. He's earthbound.

Then the camera tilts up. Between the buildings, a narrow strip of sky. Stars. A planet on the horizon. The frame opens wide, the colony shrinks to nothing and the cosmos fills the screen.

> "Some people just ain't cut out for life on solid ground. Some of us... yearn for something more. It's out there. Into the void. Beyond the moons. Amongst the stars."

## Scene 2, Making the Leap

He boards a free one-way shuttle to the mining frontier. No ship of his own. Just cargo. The night before, an old miner in a bar on Setesh pressed a crystal shard into his hand, electric blue, barely a sliver. Scottium. The rarest ore in the void. "That's what's out there, kid," the man said. He pockets it. Inside the cabin, strangers sit in silence. One catches his eye across the aisle. A nod. Nothing more.

Through the viewport, the colony shrinks. His reflection hangs ghostlike in the glass, overlaid on the world he's leaving. The shuttle punches through the atmosphere and the stars welcome him.

> "Didn't have much. Didn't even have a ship. But there was a shuttle, free ride, one way, bound for the stars. Old miner in a bar gave me something the night before. A piece of crystal, Scottium. Barely a sliver. Said 'That's what's out there, kid.' Held onto it like a promise."
>
> "Watched the colony get small through the viewport. Didn't feel brave. Just felt... done with being small."
>
> "The day I punched out of the atmosphere... that was the day I started living."

## Scene 3, Living the Dream

He's out there. Weaving between tumbling asteroids, mining beam cracking rock, scanner highlighting claims. Golden light everywhere, ore veins, floating debris, the glow of a full cargo hold. Every rock is a lottery ticket. He's learning the craft, and he loves it.

Then one day, the scanner lights up like nothing he's ever seen. Every readout maxes out at once, and the colour is wrong. Not gold. Blue. He leans forward, can't believe what he's reading. The mining beam cracks the asteroid open and the interior blazes, veins of luminous blue running through the rock like rivers of liquid sapphire. Scottium. A motherlode. Chunks break away, each one glowing that impossible cobalt, drifting into his cargo hold. The ship is bathed in searing blue light so bright it casts his shadow through the cockpit glass.

He looks down at the shard on his dash. The old miner's gift. Same glow. Same colour. The old man knew.

The jackpot. The real thing.

> "First time I cracked an asteroid open... I knew I was never going back. Most days, anyway."
>
> "Every rock out here's a lottery ticket. And the universe? She pays out more than you'd think."
>
> "Then one day... the scanner lit up like nothing I'd ever seen. Hit the jackpot. Scottium. The real thing. Enough to change everything."
>
> "Looked down at that little shard the old man gave me... same glow. He knew. He always knew."

## Scene 4, The Price of Fortune

He's still loading the last blue-glowing fragments when the pirates arrive. Scottium shines a long way in the dark. Two angular silhouettes slip between the asteroids behind him. He doesn't see them.

Then everything explodes. Weapon fire. Hull damage. Alarms. Sparks showering from cracked consoles. His cockpit shakes apart around him. The pirates breach his cargo hold, the Scottium ore spills out into the void in slow motion, every glowing blue chunk of his fortune drifting away into black. A pirate tractor-beams it all. Takes everything.

> "Thing about the void... you're not the only one out here. And Scottium? That electric blue glow shines a long way in the dark."
>
> "They came out of nowhere. Hit us before we could even think about running."
>
> "Watched my whole fortune spill out into the black. Every last piece of Scottium, just... gone."

## Scene 5, The Cavalry

A pirate takes a hit from off-screen. Then another. Someone fired, but who? The camera pulls back: a fleet of allied ships drops out of hyperspace, engines blazing. Miners, fighters, strangers, all converging. The battle erupts. Weapon fire criss-crosses the asteroid field, explosions bloom on pirate hulls, ships weave between rocks at speed.

The cockpit goes quiet. Alarms stop. Through the windscreen: allies in formation, the fight winding down. He leans back. Breathes.

> "When you're out there, alone, under fire... you find out what community really means."
>
> "They came for us. Miners, fighters, strangers. Out here, nobody flies alone."

---

## Scene 6, Despair

Relief lasts about ten seconds. A massive pirate armada drops from hyperspace, 15, 20 ships, maybe more. Red engine glows fill the frame. The allied fleet looks tiny.

Inside the cockpit, no narration. Just scanner pings accelerating, breathing, and red light consuming every warm surface. His hand tightens on the controls. The two fleets face each other across the void. Terrible stillness.

> "For a moment there... I thought we had it."
>
> (Silence.)
>
> "And for the first time out here... I was afraid."

---

## Scene 7, The Tide Turns

But miners are stubborn. Word travels fast. More allied ships warp in, one, then three, then a wave. The balance shifts. The allied fleet charges as one, a tidal wave of golden engine trails. Pirates scatter, explode, flee. The bully is running.

Then, drifting through the wreckage of a destroyed pirate ship, he sees it. A charged blue light. His Scottium. Still glowing that unmistakable blue among the twisted hull plating and sparking debris, like embers in ash. The pirate that stole it is gone. The Scottium is just... there. Waiting. His cargo scoop activates. One piece. Then another. Then a stream of luminous fragments pulled home.

> "But that's the thing about miners... we're stubborn. Word travels fast out here. And when it does... they all show up."
>
> "And there it was. Floating in the wreckage of the bastard that took it. Every last piece of Scottium, just... drifting. Waiting for me."

## Scene 8, Back to Business

Next morning. Same asteroid field. But a better ship, upgraded, battle-scarred, piloted with earned confidence. The mining beam is precise. The extraction is clean. A professional doing what they're best at.

Inside the cockpit, the camera reads the ship like a diary. Welded repair seams. A scratched tally of claims on the console edge. And there, mounted to the dash with a crude bracket, the Scottium shard from the old miner on Setesh. The same tiny crystal from the bar. It catches the warm cockpit light and glows faintly, that same vivid blue. The jackpot. The wreckage. The audience has seen that blue fill an asteroid, spill into the void, and drift home. Now it sits on his dashboard, quiet and sacred.

Through the viewport, far away: a shuttle of new arrivals approaches. He was them once. Maybe one of them has a shard in their pocket too.

Other mining ships work the field in the distance. A community, alive and at home in the cosmos.

> "Next morning... back at it. Same rocks. Same void. But I wasn't the same."
>
> "Still got that shard."

---

## Scene 9, Fade to Black

His ship recedes into the starfield. The frame darkens at the edges.

> "Void's quiet tonight." One last time in the cockpit, fully relaxed, gazing at infinite stars. Peace. Then the corner of his mouth lifts.

Fade to black. Silence. Then three words in the dark.

> "People ask me why I stay out here. After everything." (beat) "I just... don't know how to leave."
>
> "And the pirates? Oh, they'll be back. They always come back."
>
> "But so do we."

## The Arc

**Longing → Courage → Joy → Scottium Jackpot → Robbery → Community → Despair → Triumph → Scottium Reclaimed → Belonging**

## The Scottium Thread

The Scottium ore runs through the whole film: **given** as a shard by an old miner → **recognised** when the jackpot asteroid blazes the same searing blue → **stolen** by pirates → **recovered** from their wreckage → **displayed** on the dashboard, full circle. The battle is the community's victory. The Scottium coming home is his.

## The Talisman

The Scottium shard from the old miner on Setesh, pressed into his hand the night before he left, ends the film mounted on his dashboard like a sacred relic. The audience has seen that same unearthly glow fill an asteroid, spill into the void, and drift home through pirate wreckage. When the camera lingers on the tiny shard in Scene 8, it carries the weight of the entire film. And through the viewport, a shuttle of new arrivals approaches. The cycle continues.
